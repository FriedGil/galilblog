Shalom Galil Families!
Today was one of our last few full days of first session, and between power outages, Shabbat, and Revo, it was one of our first normal days in a while. We started the day off by gathering around the toren to raise the flags and learn some intriguing backstory to the Ivrit Shimushit plot. For breakfast, chanichimot enjoyed pancakes and eggs before heading to avodah. After taking some time to tidy up their tzrifim, everyone headed to sadnaot. With comms, the bonimot tried some crazy group yoga poses for a photoshoot.
In pish alef, each kvutzah had peulot from our anti-racism curriculum. They enjoyed some lunch and some free time before heading to their chuggim. Next up was pish bet, followed by a snack and some sports. They had the chance to take a dip in the pool before shira and hikansut erev, after which we all headed to dinner. However, when David accidentally splashed water on a few other tzevet members, they unexpectedly transformed into mermaids! This led into a fun H2O themed tochinit erev where kids did mermaid-themed activities like fishing for candy and chipping magic necklaces out of ice. The night closed out with a camp-wide pool party where chanichimot helped make a magical whirlpool for the mer-tzevet.
Tuesday was our last normal day at camp. We started off the morning by gathering around the toren to sing some camp anthems and raise the flags. Afterwards, campers headed off to a delicious breakfast of egg burritos. We had avodah to start getting the campsite ready for next session and then went to sadnaot. With comms, say-tzo attempted some of the cool poses that the bonimot had mastered the day before. They then headed off to pish alef before a yummy lunch of sloppy joes. After lunch, chanichimot had some time to rest before going to chuggim. In the paleontology chug, campers made a David Attenborough style nature documentary. Next up was pish bet, a snack, and sports. After a chance to dip in the pool and/or shower, we headed to shira, hitkansut erev, and dinner. Strangely, all of tzevet seemed to have entered a very sudden goth phase, which really clashed with the preppy Met Gala theme that greeted chanichimot in the chadar.
After iconic Vogue editor Anna Wintour announced her distaste for the goths, they announced their plan to break into the Met Gala! And when tzevet asked chanichimot to come dressed in all black, the true nature of this tochinit erev revealed itself: it was time for ZAP! A fun recurring activity at Camp Galil, this game involves campers trying to sneak from one side of camp to the other in the dark without getting caught by tzevet. When cover was sparse, they had the option of becoming a tree, a rock, or a houseâ€“ however, none of those positions allow for any movement. When chanichimot reached the end, they were greeted by a special snack of pretzel rods and a fun goth dance party before bedtime.
