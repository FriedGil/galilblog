Shalom Galil families!
Today was the last day of first session at machaneh Galil! We started the day off around the toren to raise the flags before heading to a yummy breakfast of quiche bites and hashbrowns. Kids had one last session of avodah, and some time to get their tzrifim looking nice before going to sadnaot. Next up was pish alef, after which kids headed off to lunch. They took some time to rest before their last chuggim meeting. During pish bet and schiya chofshit, they took some time to pack their stuff up to go home and then grabbed a snack and played some sports. After the final shira and hikansut erev, everyone was ready for dinner. 
Suddenly, some minor celebrities from TikTok pulled up to camp to announce that they would be throwing a party tonight, and all of camp was invited! But first, chanichimot sat down for a delicious Young Sheldon style family dinner of chicken wings, asparagus, and Hawaian rolls. One table did the math and figured out that they had collectively eaten roughly 48 chichkens worth of wings! At the end of dinner, we pulled up a projector to show a video of various tzevet members prepping their tiktok lingo for the messiba (party).

By 8:45, everyone gathered at the refet for an awesome party! While they danced to fun music, kids cycled through stations including cup pong, a dunk tank, and a Galil classic called Anything for Candy, where madatz and tzevet got kids to do funny tasks in exchange for candy. Halfway through, Galil recieved a visit from an ice cream truck! After dancing some more, everyone went and changed into swimsuits for the next phase of the party. As they walked down the steps to the pool, Chanichimot discovered a crazy Spongebob/meme themed pool party.

The kids took some time to splash around and listen to more fun music before going to get some Dunkin Donuts in the moadon, where they watched a movie together. Afterwards, the older kids went back to their tzrifim to have some time together. Final nights can get a bit crazy– especially since it’s the one night of camp where there is no bedtime whatsoever– and tonight’s shenanigans ranged from dying the hair of one very willing madrich to organized efforts to move large structures to entirely different places. By the time most- or at least some- of camp was in bed, Tzevet had a big clean up task ahead of them. The kids, however, were ready to leave, however messy the camp may look. 
Final Messiba is a crazy, fun night, where the kids get a lot of freedom to do almost whatever they want as they spend their last few hours with their friends. As crazy as it can get, all the chaos is worth it to leave chanichimot with one last great memory at Camp Galil.
