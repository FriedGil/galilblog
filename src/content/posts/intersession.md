Shalom, Galil families!
My name is Sebina and I’ll be the communications specialist this session. I’m in kvutzah 74, meaning this is my first year on tzevet. I worked with Chotrimot (rising 6th graders) during First Session, and I’m excited to be exploring a new <em>tafkid</em> (role). I look forward to sharing updates of what the <em>chanichimot</em> (campers) are up to, and plenty of pictures of them as they participate in enriching activities.

Intersession, a 3-day long event run by the madatz (counselors in training), was a blast! The theme was inspired by a former member of their kvutzah (age group), and they paid tribute to him through their programming. Chanichimot played the annual camp-wide game of “killler,” where you must eliminate your assigned target from the competition by saying the kill phrase and they can only be saved if a bystander says the safe phrase in time. The kill phrase was “heeyyy shawteeeyy” and the safe phrase was “I’m goin’ to the MMM.” Alliances formed and friends didn’t leave each others’ side so they could save each other, so the game provided entertainment for all of intersession!
Another highlight was the classic intersession trip to the movies. After a fun filled bus ride, kids arrived at the theater where they saw Despicable Me 4! Everyone enjoyed a healthy dose of buttery popcorn, Gru, and the minions before boarding the bus back to machaneh (camp).

Upon returning, the madatz played a starring role in modified versions of our shabbat activities, like kabbalat shabbat (age group performance) and oneg (play). The rest of the campers watched in amusement before joining in for rikkud (israeli dancing). Some of tzevet (staff/counselors) even took a break from planning for a few of the favorites, like Feker Libi.

Saturday was visitor’s day! Families reunited after being apart for 3 weeks, a huge accomplishment for many new campers. We welcomed friends, parents, siblings, grandparents, and even dogs up the hill to the kikar (sports field), where they enjoyed a picnic-style lunch and got a chance to catch up. Then, everyone gathered at the mini mo for some rikkud and a song before saying goodbye.

During chofesh (free time), some campers prepared decorations ahead of opening day to welcome their incoming friends, while others wondered who their second session tzevet would be. The wait was finally over when each group of tzevet creatively introduced themselves to their new kids. For example, bogrimot (rising 10th graders) tzevet dressed in costumes from head to toe and had chanichimot guess who was who before revealing their faces and confirming the guesses.

As the day came to a close, we ate a delightful Shabbat dinner of matzo ball soup, chicken, challah, and vegetables. Next, everyone circled up for kumzits and sang songs like Home and Little Talks. Then was havdallah, where the madatz led everyone in prayers and songs to conclude Shabbat.

This week, medurah and musicale, two Shabbat traditions where chanichimot show off their talents, were combined into one awesome event called meducal. Kids sang parodies, juggled, told stories, performed original raps, and more. Notably, some of the bonimot (rising 9th graders) performed a silly but meaningful song that they wrote for one of their tzevet members from first session.
Finally, the kids headed to the chadar ohel (dining hall) for a sweet treat of glida (ice cream)! The flavors included vanilla and cookies &amp; cream, and the topping choices were sprinkles, chocolate sauce, and crushed oreos. After licking their bowls clean, everyone headed off to bed. Laila tov!<br/>
