Shalom Galil Families!
As we gathered around the toren on Friday morning, Chanichimot were quick to point out that it “smells like Shabbos up in here!”
We headed to breakfast, where campers feasted on muffins made specially by the Bonimot. Afterwards, we had extra <em>avodah</em> and <em>nikayon tzrif</em> time to get camp ready for Shabbat. Our Madatz ran some fun <em>chuggim</em> for the kids to pick from, and then everyone got into fun costumes to show their <em>ruach</em> for Shabbat Shira.
Next up, we gathered in Hyde Park for pizza. This week saw the return of a Galil classic: sprinkle pizza! Although it got some questionable reviews, most chanichimot would argree that the funky topping is too iconic to let go of. They then had a session at Hyde Park where any and all campers were able to voice their concerns with the way that camp is run. It’s an opportunity for some real constructive feedback– but mostly it’s just a lot of fun. Afterwards, they had a good chunk of freetime for swimming, playing sports, chilling with their kvutzah, and getting ready for Shabbat. Once everyone was clean and dressed up nice, we gathered in mishpachot, little groups of kids both random and related as a space to check in about the week. Everyone is invited to share their rose (best part of the week), thorn (worst part of the week), and their bud (what they’re looking forward to).
After checking in with each other, we began the Shabbat procession and gathered around the toren. This is a special time where tzevet say the blessing for cildren over their chanichimot. Then, Say-tzo led all of camp to the mini mo, where they led us for Kabbalat Shabbat. After, we headed to the chadar for a delicious Shabbat dinner of chicken, potatoes, and soup. Once everyone’s bellies were full, we went outside the chadar for more Shabbat Shira before changing out of our nice clothes to get ready for Rikkud. But first, chanichimot gathered in the Refet to watch the Bonimot’s oneg play. Finally, it was time for Rikkud in the mo! Chanichimot and Tzevet alike danced until we were all red in the face and we were ready to find out who had the cleanest tzrif this week and would win the prestigious prize of the Golden Broom. Afterwards, madatz and tzevet performed their datz calls for all of camp. The night ended with more Rikkud!
Saturday started off with a hefty sleep in, and chanichimot rolled in to the chadar for a special sugary Shabbat breakfast of donuts and creal. After breakfast, the Bogrimot ran fun chuggim for the younger chanichimot. Then, we had Chuggim Ritzanim, special serious chuggim run by tzevet. Campers had a yummy Israeli lunch by kvutzah in various locations throughout camp. They took some more time to rest and then went to peulot run by their madatz. Next, each kvutzah did some chill activities together and then had a chance to swim and play some sports. After a quick shower, kids enjoyed a snack before going to Musicale, a weekly talent show where every kid has the opportunity to perform an act for the rest of camp.
After singing their hearts out, everyone went to dinner. Afterwards, there was more rest time before chanichimot gathered by the mini mo for kumzitz, a fun and chill block where we sing songs together. We then said goodbye to Shabbat with Havdallah. At Galil, Havdallah involves chanichimot holding hands with their kvutza and laying down in a spiral to enjoy a musical performance by a few tzevet.  At last, we reached what for many is the highlight of the week: Medurah! Run by the Bogrimot, this fun tradition consists of performances and skits, some classic and some new, in front of a massive bonfire prepared by the medurah avodah. Highlights of this week’s medurah included juggling, limbo, and a kid who ate food out of his sock while telling a joke. As the fire died down, each kvutzah walked over to the chadar, where they enjoyed ice cream as the Madatz announced that tommorow would be Revo!
All in all, this Shabbat was a beautiful and meaningful end to a fun week. Although it was sad to remember that this was the last Shabbat of first session, chanichimot had a day of craziness and fun waiting for them on Sunday with Revo!
